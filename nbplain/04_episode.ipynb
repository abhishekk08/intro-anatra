    "\n",
    "* ```/home```: 500GB shared partition. Each user is given a home folder, with a soft quota of 5GB and a hard quota of 6GB. You can check your quota usage with ```quota -us <username>```. \n",
    "  \n",
    "* ```/scratch```: 10TB shared file storage. It is <font size=\"3\">**not backed up**</font> and should not be used for storing data long term. This space can be accessed from both the login and compute nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "* ```/apps/```: 1TB Azure managed Disk. This space contains centrally compiled software for use of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```/local```: The disk local to the machine being used. On compute nodes, there is 960 GB of NVMe storage located in this area, only accessible from the compute node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects on Anatra are assigned storage space in ```/scratch/projects/[project-id]```, with a soft quota of 100GB and a hard quota of 110GB by default. Access to this space can be shared by multiple users, with the project owner managing access via the [UNIX group management tool](https://www.bath.ac.uk/account/cas-bin/group-admin). Generally speaking, your working directory for SLURM jobs should be in a subdirectory of ```/scratch/projects/[project-id]```."
